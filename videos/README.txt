HOW TO ADD YOUR VIDEOS
======================

1. Copy your video files into this folder

2. Rename them as:
   - video1.mp4
   - video2.mp4
   - video3.mp4
   - video4.mp4

3. Supported formats:
   - MP4 (.mp4) - Most common, works on all browsers
   - WebM (.webm)
   - OGG (.ogg)

4. The videos will play with audio and have controls (play, pause, volume, fullscreen)

5. You can add more videos by copying the video-item HTML block in the code

6. To customize captions, edit the text in <div class="video-caption">

NOTE: 
- Videos will NOT autoplay (user must click play)
- Each video has its own controls
- Videos include audio
- For best results, keep videos under 50MB each for faster loading
